## Background
The [IBM Watson Natural Language Processing library](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/language-translator) is a Python library that provides basic natural language processing (NLP) such as syntax analysis and keyword extraction with out-of-the-box, pre-trained models. The Watson NLP library also makes it simple to customize the language models with dictionaries of your domain-specific terms.

[MURAL](https://mural.co) is an online tool that is like a virtual whiteboard: you can draw shapes, stick notes, and move things around. It’s a fabulous tool for visually organizing ideas, designing solutions, and collaborating with teammates — in real time or asynchronously.

## About the workshop
**Wednesday, November 16th, 2022**

The workshop is in two parts:
- Part 1: 10:30am - noon (Toronto time) See: [WeaveSphere web page](https://weavesphere.co/weavesphere2022/site/sessions/?event=weavesphere2022&section=130665&id=SESXEOTAB3B3ACSCC)
- Part 2: 1:00pm - 2:30pm (Toronto time) See: [WeaveSphere web page](https://weavesphere.co/weavesphere2022/site/sessions/?event=weavesphere2022&section=130665&id=SES0K0CZAV89UMJI8)

In this workshop, participants will use the Watson NLP library and the MURAL API to work with murals:
1. Read the contents of sticky notes using the MURAL API
2. Analyze sticky note contents using Watson NLP
3. Cluster sticky notes based on theme
4. Programmatically move sticky notes in a mural into groups based on NLP analysis
